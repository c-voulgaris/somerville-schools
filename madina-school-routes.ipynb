    "# Initial setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook should be in a directory that also contains a folder called `Cities` that includes one or more subfolders (each might represent\n",
    "an individual city or case). Each of these should contain a folder called `Data` that includes the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A geojson file with a line layer representing the pedestrian network (e.g. sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian trails)\n",
    "* A geojson file with a point layer representing trip origins (e.g. student residences)\n",
    "* A geojson file with a point layer represting trip destinations (e.g. school entrances)\n",
    "* A csv file called `pairings.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pairings.csv` file will include the one row for each simulation you want to run and the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Flow_name`: a name that you define to describe the set of flows (this will inform the file names that Madina will save your results to)\n",
    "* `Network_File`: the name of the geojson file with a line layer representing the pedestrian network\n",
    "* `Network_Cost`: either the term `Geometric` (if travel cost is directly proportional to distance) or the name of an attribute in the pedestrian network layer that represents the travel cost of each link\n",
    "* `Origin_File`: the name of the geojson file with a point layer representing trip origins\n",
    "* `Origin_Name`: a name that you define to describe the origins (this is used in generating file names for the results)\n",
    "* `Origin_Weight`: either the term `Count` (if each origin represents one potential trip) or a variable indicating the potential number of trips generated by each origin\n",
    "* `Destination_File`: the name of the geojson file with a point layer representing trip destinations\n",
    "* `Destination_Name`: a name that you define to describe the destinations (this is used in generating file names for the results)\n",
    "* `Destination_Weight`: either the term `Count` (if each destination represents one potential trip) or a variable indicating the potential number of trips generated by each destination\n",
    "* `Radius`: The search radius (in the same units as the network file's coordinate reference system) from origins to destinations. This should be the maximum distance someone might reasonably walk. \n",
    "* `Beta`: A parameter defining the distance-decay function for determining whether a person might walk for a given trip.\n",
    "* `Decay`: `TRUE` indicates a decay function will be applied to determine the likelihood of walking. `FALSE` assigns all potential trips (in the given search radius) to walk\n",
    "* `Decay_Mode`: Defines the form of the decay function (inverse-square or exponential)\n",
    "* `Closest_destination`: `TRUE` indicates that trips will be assigned to the closest (lowest cost) destination\n",
    "* `Detour` The ratio of a potential path cost to the lowest-cost path cost that the model assigns trips to. \n",
    "* `Elastic_Weights`: Only relevant if `Closest_destination` is `FALSE`\n",
    "* `KNN_Weight`: Only relevant if `Elastic_Weights` is `TRUE`\n",
    "* `Plateau`: Only relevant if `Elastic_Weights` is `TRUE`\n",
    "* `Turns`: `TRUE` indicates that an additional cost (or percieved distance) should be added for each turn\n",
    "* `Turn_Threshold`: indicates the angle of deviation (in decimal degrees) from a straight line a path would take to be classified as a turn\n",
    "* `Turn_Penalty`: indicates the additional cost/distance that should be added for each turn\n",

    "# Installing software\n",

    "## Install a program that will open and run Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "A sensible option is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Madina\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a virtual environment for Madina that includes geopandas and other Madina dependencies\n",
    "by opening a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS), and running the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -n madina_env -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority geopandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "The activate the environment you just created by running the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda activate madina_env`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can install Madina by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple madina`\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is still in beta and will be updated occasionally, when you want to update it, run:\n",

    "# Running a simulation in Madina\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Visual Studio Code, open the project directory you've set up, find this notebook, and run \n",
    "the following code chunk. `city_name` should be set to the name of the folder with the `Cities` directory\n",
    "that has all your data (in a folder called `Data`). `num_cores` should be set to the number of processing\n",
